## Visual Programming II - Final Project
  For this school project, we were tasked with developing our own application over the entire semester 
using Java Swift for both the back end and front end. We used NetBeans as our IDE to build the project 
and uploaded everything here to GitHub. Besides providing a complete separate presentation and written 
report for the project, some of the requirements include but are not limited to:
- Testing / "Graceful" Error Handling
- User "Experience" and Polish of Our Project
- Code Organization / Design / Style
- Project / Feature Complexity

## Project Details
  After careful consideration, I decided to create a football playmaker for my project. It's similar
to the application Hudl if you have seen that before. Essentially, users can create their own plays
by drawing offensive and defensive players within the play area. Then they can go into more detail
about each player by describing different aspects like their play path, role, position, etc.

Below is a quick video tutorial on the project I created:
